# Readio

Simple hand-coded chrome extension that prints the reading level of your last loaded web site. This site works for all domains. 
Pretty simple extension that replicates the results of my previous Python script without the need to scrape websites (or use Python code). 

**Required languages**: HTML, CSS, JS
